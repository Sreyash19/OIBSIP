        <h1>Early Life And Career</h1>
        <p>Born on January 7, 1985, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. Hamilton 
          began his racing career at the age of eight when he started competing in
           karting events. <br>He quickly rose through the ranks and won the British
            Formula Renault, Formula Three Euroseries, and GP2 championships before 
            making his Formula One debut in 2007 with the McLaren team.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-info">
        <h1>Formula One Career</h1>
        <p>In his debut season, Hamilton made an immediate impact by finishing on the podium in his first nine races, 
          including a win in Canada. He went on to finish the season as the runner-up in the championship, just one 
          point behind his teammate Fernando Alonso. <br>
          Over the next few years, Hamilton established himself as one of 
          the top drivers in the sport, winning his first World Championship in 2008 with the McLaren team. He then 
          joined the Mercedes team in 2013 and went on to dominate the sport, winning six more World Championships between 
          2014-2015 and 2017-2020. <br>
          Hamilton's success on the track is a result of his exceptional driving skills, his ability to adapt 
          to changing conditions, and his relentless pursuit of excellence. He holds several records in the sport, including 
          the most pole positions, the most podium finishes, and the most Grand Prix wins.</p>
